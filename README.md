This project leveraged Machine Learning and Auto-AI to analyze and predict the annual deaths rates by ages. 
By utilizing a range of alogrithms and techniques including Random Forest Regressor, We achieved high accuracy in predicting deaths rates across different groups.
what is mean by Auto-Ai?
AutoAI is a variation of AutoML. It extends the automation of model building to the entire AI lifecycle.
Like AutoML, AutoAI applies intelligent automation to the steps of building predictive machine learning models.
The best performing pipelines can be put into production to process new data and deliver predictions based on the model training.
